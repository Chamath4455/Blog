The financial statements used in accounting are a concise summary of financial transactions over an accounting period, summarizing a company's operations, financial position and cash flows. (Fernando, 2024)

2.1 scope of accounting

An organization's financial stability and regulatory compliance are strengthened by the unique skills and knowledge that each function in this domain brings to the table. The following list includes numerous well-known accounting occupations that are essential to the financial environment:
•	Auditor
Internal or external auditors play an essential role for safeguarding assets, confirming the accuracy of financial statements and ensuring that organizations adhere to financial standards and laws.
•	Forensic accountant
A forensic accountant keeps a check on both internal and external activity in order to look into a person's or company's transactions.
•	Tax accountant
A tax accountant strategically arranges the best possible corporate structure to reduce tax obligations and guarantees that tax reporting is done.
•	Managerial accountants

2.2 purpose of accounting 
Accounting is a critical function that helps a company's strategic planning, growth, and compliance needs. Accounting staff may not have regular interactions with customers, product developers, or manufacture employees, but they play an important role in assuring the organization's financial health and stability.
Accounting is critical to a company's growth. An organization cannot make informed financial decisions through forecasting if it lacks insight into its business performance. Without accounting, a firm would be unable to identify its best-selling items, calculate departmental profitability or understand the influence of overhead expenditures on its bottom line.
Accounting is a key part in obtaining money. Investors require financial statements to analyses a company's financial health before investing funds. Similarly, lenders frequently require enterprises to furnish accounting-compliant financial statements as part of the loan application process.
Accounting is necessary for firms to handle their money successfully. Companies frequently provide credit to clients, allowing them to pay for goods or services over time rather than at the time of purchase. Without effective accounting standards, a corporation may struggle to keep track of existing receivables and payment deadlines. Accounting is also necessary for public corporations, which must submit periodic financial statements in accordance with SIRF or IFRS. Failure to do so may result in the company being delisted from an exchange. Furthermore, noncompliance with tax accounting requirements might result in fines and penalties.
3.	Role of financial accounting in the decision making processes  of a organizational, stakeholder and societal needs and expectations.

The Function of Finance in Making Strategic Decisions
A business's long-term strategic decision-making process heavily relies on finance. It offers the data and analysis required to determine possible risks and possibilities as well as assess the financial viability of strategic projects.
One of the most important ways that finance influences the process of making strategic decisions is through financial forecasting and the evaluation of financial risks related to such decisions.
Financial reporting and analysis sometimes concentrate on short-term outcomes, whereas strategic decisions usually have long-term effects. It might be difficult to strike a balance between long-term strategic objectives and the requirement for immediate financial performance.
Sophisticated financial modelling and analysis are frequently needed for strategic decisions. Making decisions frequently takes place in a setting without access to accurate and comprehensive information. Consequently, it's critical to be able to generate results depending on many hypotheses.
It might take a lot of time and resources to create thorough and accurate financial models. Developing models that are easily adaptable to changing assumptions or an increase in the number of assumptions is a difficulty.
3.2 Financial accounting meeting stakeholder needs & expectations.
Accountants must balance the needs of various stakeholders. This has a direct impact on the company's sustainability and performance. Each group has different interests and needs. Effective management of these can result in a pleasant business atmosphere and improve the organization's reputation. Stakeholder management fosters trust and long-term connections, which are essential for a company's resilience and growth. Understanding and incorporating stakeholder expectations can boost innovation and competitiveness, which benefits the firm.
Provide clear financial reports.
Shareholders require clear, transparent financial reports and insights. This demonstrates the company's financial strength and strategic orientation. It comprises strategic storylines that go beyond financial indicators to provide a holistic picture of performance and prospects. The accounting must also ensure that the company's financial strategy generate long-term growth while safeguarding and increasing shareholder value.

This is necessary for the smooth operation of society and the economy.

These reports can then be used to evaluate a client's financial situation and weaknesses.
•	Communication
Accountants spend time in meetings with clients, stakeholders and coworkers. They frequently need to provide financial updates. In larger firms or businesses with more complex accounting requirements, accountants may also collaborate with one another.
Expert communication abilities are required to develop your accounting career. Most of the time, accounting managers talk to their direct reports, controllers, finance directors and coworkers from other areas who may not know as much about accounting terms.
(Gallagher, 2022)

The integration of technology breakthroughs, such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, has transformed the accounting profession. These advances improved the accuracy and efficiency of financial processes. Automation has reduced the human effort associated with traditional accounting activities, freeing accountants to focus on analytical and advisory roles.

Accountants use financial data analysis to provide valuable insights that guide long-term strategic planning and opportunities for company expansion.

8.	Issues of Ethics Regulations and Competences 
Ethical behavior in accounting is critical for ensuring transparency, integrity and accountability in financial reporting. Regulatory frameworks such as GAAP and IFRS establish standards for financial disclosure, while compliance measures prevent fraud and wrongdoing. (Team, 2024)
•	Ethics in Accounting 
Accounting ethics requires adherence to rules of conduct, professional standards, and codes of conduct in all aspects of accounting practice. Accountants are expected to show integrity, objectivity, competence, confidentiality, and professionalism in their work. Financial reporting, auditing, tax compliance and client relationships are all examples of ethical dilemmas. Ethical decision-making entails identifying these issues, weighing alternatives and selecting actions that uphold ethical standards and serve the public interest.

(Team, 2024)
•	Competences
Compliance with the regulations, statutes, and standards that govern the accounting industry is important. The maintenance of financial records and the creation and display of reports are included in this. In addition to many state, federal, and international duties, accountants must make sure their operations comply with a variety of tax laws and regulations. Verifying that financial practices adhere to the established standards of accounting bodies requires routine audits. In order to preserve confidence among investors and in markets, these audits are essential.
•	Reliability and Risk
Adherence to ethical codes, regulations, and laws is critical for establishing trust and providing accurate financial information. Noncompliance or ethical issues can have serious consequences for businesses, including penalties, reputational damage, and a loss of stakeholder trust. Risk in these areas is critical for a company's credibility, long-term viability and market share.
