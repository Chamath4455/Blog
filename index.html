                    <h2>1. Introduction to Accounting</h2>
                    <p>Accounting is the practice of keeping track of company transactions. Transactions are compiled, examined and reported to oversight, regulatory and tax authorities as part of this process. The financial statements used in accounting are a concise summary of financial transactions over an accounting period, summarizing a company's operations, financial position and cash flows. (Fernando, 2024)</p>

                    <h2>2. Scope & Purpose of Accounting</h2>
                    
                    <h3>2.1 Scope of Accounting</h3>
                    <p>Accounting covers a wide range of tasks that are essential to every sector. An organization's financial stability and regulatory compliance are strengthened by the unique skills and knowledge that each function in this domain brings to the table. The following list includes numerous well-known accounting occupations that are essential to the financial environment:</p>
                    
                    <h4>Auditor</h4>
                    <p>Internal or external auditors play an essential role for safeguarding assets, confirming the accuracy of financial statements and ensuring that organizations adhere to financial standards and laws.</p>

                    <h4>Forensic Accountant</h4>
                    <p>A forensic accountant keeps a check on both internal and external activity in order to look into a person's or company's transactions.</p>

                    <h4>Tax Accountant</h4>
                    <p>A tax accountant strategically arranges the best possible corporate structure to reduce tax obligations and guarantees that tax reporting is done.</p>

                    <h4>Managerial Accountants</h4>
                    <p>Managerial accountants examine financial transactions in order to offer strategic, well-considered advice, frequently pertaining to the production of goods.</p>

                    <h3>2.2 Purpose of Accounting</h3>
                    <p>Accounting is a critical function that helps a company's strategic planning, growth, and compliance needs. Accounting staff may not have regular interactions with customers, product developers, or manufacture employees, but they play an important role in assuring the organization's financial health and stability.</p>
                    
                    <p>Accounting is critical to a company's growth. An organization cannot make informed financial decisions through forecasting if it lacks insight into its business performance. Without accounting, a firm would be unable to identify its best-selling items, calculate departmental profitability or understand the influence of overhead expenditures on its bottom line.</p>
                    
                    <p>Accounting is a key part in obtaining money. Investors require financial statements to analyses a company's financial health before investing funds. Similarly, lenders frequently require enterprises to furnish accounting-compliant financial statements as part of the loan application process.</p>
                    
                    <p>Accounting is necessary for firms to handle their money successfully. Companies frequently provide credit to clients, allowing them to pay for goods or services over time rather than at the time of purchase. Without effective accounting standards, a corporation may struggle to keep track of existing receivables and payment deadlines. Accounting is also necessary for public corporations, which must submit periodic financial statements in accordance with SIRF or IFRS. Failure to do so may result in the company being delisted from an exchange. Furthermore, noncompliance with tax accounting requirements might result in fines and penalties.</p>

                    <h2>3. Role of Financial Accounting in Decision Making</h2>
                    <h3>3.1 Role of Financial Accounting in the Decision-Making Process</h3>
                    <h4>The Function of Finance in Making Strategic Decisions</h4>
                    <p>A business's long-term strategic decision-making process heavily relies on finance. It offers the data and analysis required to determine possible risks and possibilities as well as assess the financial viability of strategic projects.</p>
                    
                    <p>One of the most important ways that finance influences the process of making strategic decisions is through financial forecasting and the evaluation of financial risks related to such decisions.</p>
                    
                    <p>Financial reporting and analysis sometimes concentrate on short-term outcomes, whereas strategic decisions usually have long-term effects. It might be difficult to strike a balance between long-term strategic objectives and the requirement for immediate financial performance.</p>
                    
                    <p>Sophisticated financial modelling and analysis are frequently needed for strategic decisions. Making decisions frequently takes place in a setting without access to accurate and comprehensive information. Consequently, it's critical to be able to generate results depending on many hypotheses.</p>
                    
                    <p>It might take a lot of time and resources to create thorough and accurate financial models. Developing models that are easily adaptable to changing assumptions or an increase in the number of assumptions is a difficulty.</p>

                    <h3>3.2 Financial Accounting Meeting Stakeholder Needs & Expectations</h3>
                    <p>Accountants must balance the needs of various stakeholders. This has a direct impact on the company's sustainability and performance. Each group has different interests and needs. Effective management of these can result in a pleasant business atmosphere and improve the organization's reputation. Stakeholder management fosters trust and long-term connections, which are essential for a company's resilience and growth. Understanding and incorporating stakeholder expectations can boost innovation and competitiveness, which benefits the firm.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Provide Clear Financial Reports</h4>
                    <p>Shareholders require clear, transparent financial reports and insights. This demonstrates the company's financial strength and strategic orientation. It comprises strategic storylines that go beyond financial indicators to provide a holistic picture of performance and prospects. The accounting must also ensure that the company's financial strategy generate long-term growth while safeguarding and increasing shareholder value. (DeMar, 2024)</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>Ethical behavior in accounting is critical for ensuring transparency, integrity and accountability in financial reporting. Regulatory frameworks such as GAAP and IFRS establish standards for financial disclosure, while compliance measures prevent fraud and wrongdoing. (Team, 2024)</p>

                    <h4>Ethics in Accounting</h4>
                    <p>Accounting ethics requires adherence to rules of conduct, professional standards, and codes of conduct in all aspects of accounting practice.

Ethical decision-making entails identifying these issues, weighing alternatives and selecting actions that uphold ethical standards and serve the public interest.</p>

                    <h4>Regulations</h4>
